A few years back, just like everybody else thinking about their first startup, we thought we had to protect our ideas, sign the NDA first, blablabla.  
Later, we realized it was all **bs**. Competition is actually good.

When I built **WriteMage**, right after ChatGPT first came out in early 2023, I was always looking for the new competitors popping up every day.  
I was scared.

That was one of the reasons I sold my app too early.  
The other reason was that I had to finish my **medical degree**.

Last week, I heard about **Axiom** â€” a YC-backed startup building a trading platform like **Photon** and **Bannanagun**.

What caught my attention was that I had also been building a trading platform â€” sunburst.exchange.
I even had a chat with the **TradingView** team about integrating advanced charting into Sunburst.

Axiom popped up in one of the most competitive spaces, but they still managed to grab a large market share in trading  
â€” and became one of the most successful startups (ofc by bribing CT with YC money ðŸ’°).

In this **AI era** and **attention economy**, attention is everything.  
**Building a startup isnâ€™t the hard part anymore â€” building a good, sustainable one is.**
